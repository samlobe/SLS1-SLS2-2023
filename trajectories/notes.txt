All trajectories are excluding the explicit water (to keep file sizes low).
For the dimer trajectories, I outputted monomer A is in the center (in the full simulation monomer A was freely floating).
All trajectories are just for the 300K temperature. Other REMD temp simulations were not uploaded to github due to file size constraints.
