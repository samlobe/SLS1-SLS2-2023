For each peptide, I did REMD simulations of the HID and HIE protonation states for H299.
I show the energy landscape (or combination of landscapes - Bolzmann weighted) that has the most favorable unfolding pathways.
For P301 and P301L, the HIE protonation state was most favorable.
For P301V, the HID protonation state was most favorable.
For P301S, the combination of HID and HIE protonation states were most favorable. (I weighted each ensemble equally.)
