These are animations of PCs of backbone motions from the REMD trajectory.
The main purpose is for the viewer to see the energy landscape in an intuitive way and to see that some motions to break these two H-bonds are unfavorable in jR2R3 (i.e. the WT). 

To create the unclamp mode gif I filtered the trajectory (lower, pinched region of landscape) and took variations unclamp_cluster1.pdb (from Daura algorithm clustering of unclamp.xtc) to get principal components. I visualize PC1. PC bounds: -10 to 10 
To create the unpinch mode gif I filtered the trajectory (left, clamped region of landscape) and took variations around  cluster_zone1.pdb (from Daura algorithm clustering of zone 1, i.e. the pinched and clamped part of jR2R3_P301L's trajectory) to get principal components. I visualize PC7. PC bounds: -9 to 4.

Procedure:
1) `python unpinch_PCA.py` and `python unclamp_PCA.py` to make the energy landscape gif and the pdb files of the pc variations.
2) Make a gif of the protein motion using Pymol. I split the pdb of the pc variations into 3 to show when the H-bond was breaking/forming (according to ChimeraX's hbond algorithm), and then I combined those 3 gifs and put them into the 'just_protein_gifs' directory.
3) `python combine_gifs_unpinch.py` and `python combine_gifs_unclamp.py` to combine the energy landscape gifs and the protein motion gifs.

I reduced the file size of the final gifs (unpinch_gif_compressed.gif unclamp_gif_compressed.gif) with the online tool EZGif.com
